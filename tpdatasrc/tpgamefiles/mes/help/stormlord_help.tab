TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_STORMLORD_SPELLS_PER_DAY	TAG_STORMLORDS			Stormlord Spells per Day	At each stormlord level, the character gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if he had also gained a level in a divine spellcasting class to which he belonged before adding the prestige class level. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (improved chance of turning or destroying undead, additional favored enemies, and so on). If the character had more than one divine spellcasting class before becoming a stormlord, the player must decide to which class to add each stormlord level for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known.
