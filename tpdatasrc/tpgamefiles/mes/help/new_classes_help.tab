TAG_MARSHALS	TAG_NONCORE_CLASSES			Marshals	Sometimes it is not enough to be a conquering warrior, a champion of all that's right, an experienced sellsword, or an elite foot soldier. Sometimes the circumstances require a solid commander of soldiers and situations. Sometimes the circumstances demand a marshal.Characteristics: Trained in the basics of fighting, marshals possess a general knowledge of weapons and armor. Their real strength is their ability to lead those who follow them to success they might not otherwise reach in combat. Marshals make passable warriors themselves, when personal danger finds them.Religion: Marshals often worship Heironeous (god of valor) or Kord (god of strength). Some worship St. Cuthbert (god of retribution), Hextor (god of tyranny), or Erythnul (god of slaughter).Other Classes: The marshal relies on the other classes in all ways -- it is his job to support a team, magnifying the strengths of each member for success in battles or forays into dangerous cavern complexes.Role: In most adventuring parties, the marshal serves as the lead tactician, while his comrades support him with spells, ranged attacks, and other effects. However, once a plan is in motion, most marshals enter the melee to assure victory.Alignment: Marshals may be of any alignment. Good-aligned marshals are often crusading leaders who seek out and fight evil. Lawful-aligned marshals accept commissions from people who face invasion by foreign aggressors. Chaotic-aligned marshals lead mercenaries to wherever the pay is best. Evil-aligned marshals tend to lead forces of foreign aggressors set on invasion and plunder.Hit Die: d8Base Attack and Base Save Bonuses: see ~table~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_MARSHAL]Class Skills: ~Bluff~[TAG_BLUFF], ~Diplomacy~[TAG_DIPLOMACY], Handle Animal, ~Intimidate~[TAG_INTIMIDATE], Knowledge, ~Listen~[TAG_LISTEN], ~Perform~[TAG_PERFORM], Ride, ~Sense Motive~[TAG_SENSE_MOTIVE], Speak Language, ~Spot~[TAG_SPOT], ~Survival~[TAG_SURVIVAL], and ~Swim~[TAG_SWIM].Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modifierClass Features:[CMD_CHILDREN]

TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_MARSHAL_AURAS	TAG_MARSHALS			Marshal Auras	The marshal exerts an effect on allies in his vicinity. He can learn to produce different effects, or auras, over the course of his career. The marshal may project one minor aura and (starting at 2nd level) one major aura at a time.Projecting an aura is a swift action. The aura remains in effect until the marshal uses a free action to dismiss it or activates another aura of the same kind (major or minor). A marshal can have an aura active continually; thus, an aura can be in effect at the start of a combat encounter even before the marshal takes his first turn.Activating an aura involves haranguing, ordering, directing, encouraging, cajoling, or calming allies. A marshal sizes up the enemy, allies, and the terrain, then gives allies the direction that they can use to do their best.Unless otherwise noted, a marshal's aura affects all allies within 60 feet (including himself) who can hear the marshal. An ally must have an Intelligence score of 3 or higher and be able to understand the marshal's language to gain the bonus. A marshal's aura is dismissed if he is dazed, unconscious, stunned, paralyzed, or otherwise unable to be heard or understood by his allies.A marshal begins play knowing one minor aura of his choice. As his marshal level increases, he gains access to new auras, as indicated on Table 1-5: The Marshal.All bonuses granted by a marshal's auras are circumstance bonuses that do not stack with each other.Minor Auras:A minor aura lets allies add the marshal's Charisma bonus (if any) to certain rolls.~Minor Aura List~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_MARSHAL_MINOR_AURAS][CMD_CHILDREN_SORTED]Major Auras:Beginning at 2nd level, a marshal can project a major aura in addition to his minor aura. A major aura lets allies add +1 to certain rolls. This bonus improves by +1 at 7th, 14th, and 20th level.~Major Aura List~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_MARSHAL_MAJOR_AURAS][CMD_CHILDREN_SORTED]

TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_MARSHAL_SKILL_FOCUS	TAG_MARSHALS			Skill Focus(Diplomacy)	Because a marshal has a way with people, he gains this feat as a bonus feat. If the marshal already has the feat, he can choose a different one.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_MARSHAL_ADRENALINE_BOOST	TAG_MARSHALS			Adrenaline Boost	Starting at 4th level, you can exhort your allies to discover a reservoir of energy they didn't think they had. Once per day, as a standard action, you can grant temporary hit points equal to your marshal level to any or all of your allies within 30 feet (but not to yourself). If the ally's current hit point total is no more than half his full normal hit points, the number of temporary hit points granted to that character is doubled (to twice your marshal level).This ability only affects allies with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher who can hear you and understand your language. The temporary hit points last for up to 1 minute per marshal level.At 8th level, you can use this ability twice per day. You can use it three times per day at 12th level, four times per day at 16th level, and five times per day at 20th level.If you use this ability on a creature that is still under the effect of a previous use, the new temporary hit points overlap (do not stack with) the temporary hit points the creature had remaining.
